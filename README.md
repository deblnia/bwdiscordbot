## discord_bot_test 


Potential Features: 
- Delete note after sent so no notes get repeated 
- Configure to respond specifically to each user (specific set of notes per user, so not simulataneous deletes)
    - Or do we want them all to be rating the same note(s)? 
- Easier way / query to get list of notes to serve

Questions: 
- Deployment, should I just do like a Heroku type deal? 
    - The more offline we keep this the better I think 
- Is this easier that just like posting note links lol? 
    - Colin hates tech debt but i LOVE it 
- How many notes do we want to seed with? Per week or per day?
- Is this link / note view the best?
